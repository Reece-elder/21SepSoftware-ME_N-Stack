Documents are objects of data stored in MongoDB using BSON 

Documents DO NOT NEED TO follow a strict schema (but is generally useful to give them a schema) 

+ Much easier to update data along the line 
- Its harder to see the connections between data AND data can be come muddled

 
How to Create a document to put in the collection

insertOne() <-- Pass in the BSON we want to add

db.lizardPen.insertOne(
{
"name" : "Monty",
"species" : "Iguana",
"length" : 23
});

_id : Is a default 'primary key' unique identifier for this object, created with hexidecimal 

insertMany() to insert multiple documents

db.lizardPen.insertMany([

{
"name" : "buttercup",
"species" : "Gecko",
"favFood" : [
	"Crickets",
	"Kiwis",
	"Spinach"
	]
},
{
"name" : "Mia",
"species" : "Corn Snake",
"length" : 31,
"shedSkin" : true
}]);

Exercise - 
Using a database called zoo, pet shop, garage, cafe 
Create a collection within that database
Insert 3 document that make sense 
Each doucment should have atleast 4 fields, with 2 of them being unique to that document 

insertOne() - Contains one document
insertMany() - Contains atleast 2 documents
