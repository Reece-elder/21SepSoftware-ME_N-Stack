# Mongoose

Mongoose allows you to model objects for use with databases (Schemas, restrictions etc)

Allows interaction with DB using DB Query Language
db.collectionName.find(name : "tony") -> find();

`npm i mongoose`
Module wont work if your module name is the word mongoose!!!

`npm i express mongoose cors nodemon`

# What are we trying to achieve? 

Create a schema for a lizard
Connect my MongoDB to my application
Create routes to post and get data to my database
