# Express Testing

- We're gonna be using Mocha for our JS testing
- Asynchronous testing (CRUD apps, pushing and pulling from a database)
- Lightweight, easy to add other testing frameworks to it
- Mocha = JUnit, similar to express, simple usage but easy to add other stuff to it

`npm i -g mocha`
-g stands for global 
Installs the software globally (means you can run it from command line anywhere)

# Configuration

Modify your package.json to use mocha tests

type in command line `npm test`

Add a tests folder, within tests folder add a file that includes .test.js

# Exercise 
- Everyone to install mocha globally
- Create a new project npm init
- modify the package.json
- create a tests folder and a test file
