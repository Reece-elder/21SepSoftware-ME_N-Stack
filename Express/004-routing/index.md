# Routing

Routes - HTTP Requests ("/getAll", "/create")
So far, all code has been written in the same file, we should be seperating the routes into their own file

routes.js -> app.get("/getAll")

1) `npm init -y`
2) npm i express nodemon cors

Exercise 
Remove all routes from your index.js, put them into a routes.js file in a routes folder
