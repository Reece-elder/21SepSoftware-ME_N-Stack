# Express 

Express JS

Express is a minimalist framework for web functionality, within a JS application

Express has limited functionality BUT allows extra middleware (code that helps two codebases talk) to be added

1) npm init
2) npm install express

Exercise 
- Create a new npm project 
- Install express 
- Setup your index.js to create an app and open the app on any port
