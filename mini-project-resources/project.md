You have been hired by a trendy craft beer company to create a website for them
The websites purpose is for staff to be able to show customers the beers that are currently available, in a menu format

It should be able to do the following:
- Show all beers in the database 
- Show beer by id
- Delete beers (not being sold there) by id

This can be done in whatever way the team decides, going for simplicity over style. 

The project should consist of a front end (likely with bootstrap css), express backend and a mongodb database
Backend testing is a requirement, using testing tools covered
Backend code should feature the following: 
- Routes folder, and separate route files
- model folder with separate model files
- Custom middleware for error handling and time stamping
- Common middleware for CORS

The project should be hosted on GitHub with a proper FBM using pull requests and correct merging practices

- Admin area where you can create, update and delete beers
- Adding a collection for food (main meals and or snacks)
- consistent styling 
- front end testing with Selenium

The workload will be split between the team with the following roles: 
- scrum master (arranges the work load)
